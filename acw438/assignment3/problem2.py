#Make objects for each candidate, incl name and n#, add to list
#Add vote lists into each candidate's object, counting total # of voters
#Check if any candidates have over 50%
#If no candidates over 50%, eliminate least-popular candidates:
#For least-popular candidate voters, pop first item in list 
#Check if new top candidate has been rejected
#If new top candidate has been rejected, pop first item in list, repeat check
#Add voters to their new top candidate's object
